Building upon the code from the previous problem: when you call scanner.Text(), assign the returned string to a variable. Print that variable. On the next line, check when that variable equals an empty string. When that is true, print "THIS IS THE END OF THE HTTP REQUEST HEADERS". Break out of the scanner.Scan() loop after that line.
