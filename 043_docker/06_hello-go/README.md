# Build an image

1. Create a Dockerfile
1. Build an image from the Dockerfile

# Create Dockerfile

## Create a directory

```
mkdir mydockerbuild2
```

## Enter directory

```
cd mydockerbuild2
```

## Create a docker build file

```
nano Dockerfile
```

## Add these lines to your build file

```
# Creates an ubuntu image with curl installed
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y curl
```

# Build an image from the Dockerfile

## Docker build
Build the image using the docker build command. 

The -t parameter gives your image a tag, so you can run it more easily later. 

Donâ€™t forget the . command, which tells the docker build command to look in the current directory for a file called Dockerfile. 

```
docker build -t curler .
```

The above command reads the Dockerfile in the current directory and processes its instructions one by one to build an image called **curler** on your local machine.

# Run your new docker-whale

See what images you have on your machine:

```
docker images
```

Run your image

```
docker run -it curler /bin/bash
```

run a curl command

```
curl --head www.google.com
```
