# Understanding AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS)offers a suite of cloud-computing services that make up an on-demand computing platform. These services operate from 14 geographical regions across the world. They include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ("EC2") and Amazon Simple Storage Service ("S3"). 

As of 2016 AWS has more than 70 services including compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools and tools for the Internet of things. 

Amazon markets AWS as a service to provide large computing capacity quicker and cheaper than building your own physical server farm.

# Services

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) forms a central part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), by allowing users to **rent virtual computers** on which to run their own computer applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the hour for active servers â€“ hence the term "elastic". EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy.

## S3 - Simple Storage Service
Amazon S3 provides storage through web services interfaces (REST, SOAP, and BitTorrent). Amazon launched S3 in the United States in March 2006 and in Europe in November 2007.

At its inception, Amazon charged end users US$0.15 per gigabyte/month, with additional charges for bandwidth used sending and receiving data, and a per-request (get or put) charge. On November 1, 2008, pricing moved to tiers where end users storing more than 50 terabytes receive discounted pricing. Amazon says that S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its own global e-commerce network.

S3 uses include web hosting, image hosting, and storage for backup systems. 

## Databases

1. RDS
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business. Amazon RDS provides you six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

1. DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications. According to Forrester research, Amazon's DynamoDB is the most popular NoSQL cloud database.

1. ElastiCache
Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory data stores, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. Amazon ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory engines:

  - Redis - a fast, open source, in-memory data store and cache. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a Redis-compatible in-memory service that delivers the ease-of-use and power of Redis along with the availability, reliability and performance suitable for the most demanding applications. Both single-node and up to 15-shard clusters are available, enabling scalability to up to 3.55 TiB of in-memory data. ElastiCache for Redis is fully managed, scalable, and secure - making it an ideal candidate to power high-performance use cases such as Web, Mobile Apps, Gaming, Ad-Tech, and IoT.

  - Memcached - a widely adopted memory object caching system. ElastiCache is protocol compliant with Memcached, so popular tools that you use today with existing Memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service.

Using Amazon ElastiCache, you can add an in-memory layer to your infrastructure in a matter of minutes.

## Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered from Amazon Web Services for deploying infrastructure which orchestrates various AWS services, including 
- EC2
- S3
- Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- CloudWatch
- autoscaling
- Elastic Load Balancers.

Elastic Beanstalk provides an additional layer of abstraction over the bare server and OS; users instead see a pre-built combination of OS and platform, such as "64bit Amazon Linux 2014.03 v1.1.0 running Ruby 2.0 (Puma)" or "64bit Debian jessie v2.0.7 running Python 3.4 (Preconfigured - Docker)".

Deployment requires a number of components to be defined: an 'application' as a logical container for the project, a 'version' which is a deployable build of the application executable, a 'configuration template' that contains configuration information for both the Beanstalk environment and for the product. 

Finally an 'environment' combines a 'version' with a 'configuration' and deploys them.

Executables themselves are uploaded as archive files to S3 beforehand and the 'version' is just a pointer to this.

Supported software include: 
- PHP
- Java
- .NET
- Node.JS
- Python
- Ruby
- Docker
- Go

## Route 53
You can use Amazon Route 53 to register new domains, transfer existing domains, route traffic for your domains to your AWS and external resources, and monitor the health of your resources.
