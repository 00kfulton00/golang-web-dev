# Passing values

## Form submission

We can pass values from the client to the server through the URL or through the body of the request. 

When you submit a form, you can use either the "post" or "get" method. The "post" method sends the form submission through the body of the request. The "get" method for a form submission sends the form submission values through the url.

I remember this like this:

```
post
form

get
url
```

## URL values

You can always append values to a URL.

Anything after the ```?``` is the query string - the area where values are stored.
