# Secure sessions

We will now create state.

We will give clients a unique ID.

This unique ID is known as a univerally unique ID (UUID).

[Wikipedia says this about UUIDs:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) " ... only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one duplicate would be about 50%."

The server will be able to recognize who a request is coming from.
